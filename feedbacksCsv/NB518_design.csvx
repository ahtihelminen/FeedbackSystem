No issues with Class nor with Flag Rules;"We had 2 issues that had an impact on material availability and affected the initial budget.
#1 - Rising costs due to the global shortage of semiconductors had a negative impact during an ongoing project. Something not easy to foresee.
#2 - International sanctions struck badly the normal, well-known material supplier chain. Time-consuming efforts had to be performed to fix the issues.";"Wrong decisions were made at the beginning of the project. A reliable TK-contractor that had built the Passenger Public areas in 2 previous vessels was put aside and an incompetent contractor was chosen to work on the last vessel of the series. This was the worst action I have ever seen in my 30+ years working at the Yard. My first reaction was that the Yard was digging its own grave. First dismay came when we learned that the electrical design work was omitted from the contract. That was a huge red flag. The contractor had no responsible designer for the task. The Yard did not have the capacity to handle the work with its own personnel but had to hire a company from Croatia - on behalf of the TK-contractor, and for the TK-contractor. It was emphasized that this Croatian company is working for the TK-contractor, and they had to coordinate the design work with them (not the Yard). This never happened. The Yard had to teach the Croatians nearly everything. After the initial design work was done, the Croatians retired from their responsibilities, as it was stated in their contract. There was no-one responsible for the follow-ups and the changes that always come up during the building phase. I hope the costs of the extra tasks were estimated/calculated by the project's lead decision makers.
Lessons to be learned:
#1 - The first and paramount lesson is that a TK-contractor MUST have their own electrical designer(s) who is(are) responsible for the electrical design of the TK areas during the whole project - from the start to the end. 
#2 - The second lesson is that it is never a good idea to change a TK-contractor during a building series of vessels. There will doubtfully be any savings.";Communication depended a lot on your own activity. In my opinion communication has improved between team workers, production, and suppliers. This last TK-contractor was the worst case during my career at the Yard's design dpt. , although they had individual on-site supervisors among their personnel that understood the issues and could commendably tackle them. A light amid the darkness.;"The 2 first vessels were difficult, but the last one feels like a total mess because of the new TK. As stated earlier, it is a very risky idea to change a competent contractor in the middle of a building series.
The building areas under the responsibility of the Yard have gone with no issues and can be regarded as successful.";I sincerely hope that the above-mentioned mistakes will never occur again. This Shipyard has built many vessels with success, and I believe that the decades long trend will continue if lessons are learned. The cheapest is never the best nor will it turn out to be cheap in the end.

Mostly because it was already third vessel. Some late purchases had to made due to lost/broken equipment but this was managed in time. 

Delayed purchase of tender boat and davits also delayed design, delivery and installation (including late payments). ";"Block manufacturing timetable and detail design areas could have been more in line to give extra time for design. 

New equipment or supplier changing delayed detail design in some area (life - and tender boats). 

Some comments needed more clarification but mostly only minor changes in NB-518. ";In my opinion communication was smooth between different parties.

ECR could use water mist with pre-action system as in the wheelhouse, rather than clean agent system.

- For ease of commissioning, a set of test valves (isolating and test valves) should be added for the machinery section valves. 
- At the location of system main valves, floor drainage should be considered in future projects. 
- Also treatment of the water storage tanks should be considered in future projects by adding a treatment pump circulating water from the tanks.
";No issues in this project.;System final costs are above budget due to an erratic material consumption in all 3 vessels. The budget is mainly exceeded due to the need of creating a material buffer. Eventually, the material usage has been more realistic in NB518 versus 516/517.;Some changes came in relatively late stage from the ceiling design in public spaces (Savi).;"Communication with Savi public team has been difficult. Comments sent on their detail design seemed ineffective. 
Material handling has been a lot better in this project than in 516/517. I used some time reviewing the part list of each area and sent comments to persons in charge of detail design. The similarities with 516/517 helped also.";"Some efforts have been paid to make the system ready on time for commissioning (main line readiness, machinery spaces) with a good result. Despite changes in the yard commissioning team, we used less time from Marioff commissioning engineer (excluding the work on transfer voyage).
It is difficult to get a large system covering the whole ship ready. It is also important to keep track on the system as a whole, not only piping construction. The system finalization is also totally dependent on the electric connections. ";The system covered systems 5720 and 5740.

But it was not a challenge. Proposed solution was already accepted in reference ships.
Approval of the system by Class was done only on the base of supplier's documentation. Approval came late due to failure of the supplier to submit documentation to Class. Luckily no issue came up from approval. ";System was purchased from MINIMAX who has been supplying the Clean agent system in all 3 shios of Vega series. Tyco was the supplier for 516/517. The reason for change was only to get a better price for both systems.;Some comments related to the arrangement of the room where equipment is located came on a late stage from Owner. Some improvements were made versus previous ships in this regards. The comments were related to having a drip tray around the system equipment. This was not addressed in any other design and should have been addressed earlier. That kind of items (drip trays under equipment and their drainage arrangement) needs to be better coordinated in future projects.;Change of system responsible designer during the project made so that, there was a lack of communication and follow-up during the detail design phase. No critical issues finally but the nozzle arrangement, for example, could have been better if feedback had been given to the detail designer when asked.;"System was a little different due to change of supplier. Better arrangement around the system equipment was provided. 
One drain valve which was located outside in NB516/517 was not provided in NB518 and was commented in a late stage by Owner. The saving was not significant and the valve was useful. However, it was not added when requested by Owner due to the timing of their request. ";

This was inspected by Class and approved but there will be more inspections, for example by USCG. Situation was better in NB517 where all these inspections were carried out before the ship left teh shipyard.";"Items were purchased on time. Delivery was a little late due to invoice payment issues. However, it was without consequences due to delays in the project.
Purchases were within budget.";"First revision of the drawing was late. Class used this document to comment on general safety related issues as this gives an overview of safety on board. 
First approved revision was revision C. When preparing updated revision due to change of flag. Many items inaccurate were found. Also changes in GA plan needed to be addressed. 
Elaboration of this document is requiring more work than it looks because information is presented and categorized in a different way than on dedicated system drawings. Level of details required is not always available in other basic design documentation.
Drawing released early can receive an approval in principle. However, the drawing needs a lot of work in late phase to bring some accuracy and show exact location of equipment and devices on board. 
The difficult situation related to the fact that the ship left the shipyard unfinished was partly compensated by the good work and effort paid during the last 2 weeks to get the material installed on board. However, readiness for these items could have been achieved earlier in machinery spaces which were not late. ";The communication and cooperation has been really good in the last run to make the AS BUILT drawing ready and inspection succeed.;Situation was not as bad as in NB516 where the ship's departure was not so well anticipated. In NB517, due to the change in contract, the ship stayed longer at the shipyard than expected. This added time allowed to reach the necessary completion and readiness for a successful inspection of the fire control plan items. In NB518, the ship was not ready enough, but anticipation of the ship's departure, even though not ready helped to provide a better level than in NB516. Also the failures noticed in NB517 (missing material, wrong information...) were anticipated and corrected in NB518.;

Aina halvalla suunnittelutoimistolla esim. KT ei ole ollenkaan omaa sähkösuunnittelua vaan he tilaavat sen jostain ulkopuolelta. Tässä on monta liikkuvaa osaa jotka pitää korjata ja rikkinäinen puhelin -ongelma.
